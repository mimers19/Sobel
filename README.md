# Sobel
Processing pictures (*.bmp) with sobel operator (edges detection) in c++ without external libraries
Uploading picture, reading bytes etc is coded by me - no library is used to read from binary file
In repo files there are examples how the program works.


#Hints
1. Picture needs to be in the same file as *.exe or *.sln (depends if we use compiled vesion or debbuger)
2. There are 2 versions of processing the picture - going with original papers and examples from internet processed photos were very dimm and had very low contrast. So i made some calculations and changed value that you devide with, but "original" version is usable too.
